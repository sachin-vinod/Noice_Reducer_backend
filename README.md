# Noice_Reducer_backend
The backend of the Noise Reducer app is designed to handle audio file uploads, process them to reduce background noise, and return the processed files to the user efficiently. It leverages Spring Boot for rapid development and ease of maintenance, while Docker ensures that the application runs consistently across different environments.
